# 🧠 EpiCare - Skin Lesion Classification (Kaggle Notebook)

This repository contains the Kaggle-based development and experimentation notebook for the **EpiCare mobile skin cancer screening project**.

The notebook demonstrates how a **hybrid CNN-ViT model** is trained and optimized for real-time, on-device lesion classification. The final model is exported to **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** for integration into the mobile app.

---

## 📌 Notebook Objectives

- Load and preprocess the ISIC skin lesion dataset
- Build a hybrid model using:
  - VGG16 (CNN) for feature extraction
  - Transformer encoder layers for global context
- Train and evaluate the model (accuracy, AUC)
- Convert to `.tflite` format using TensorFlow Lite
- Save key artifacts: model, confusion matrix, plots
